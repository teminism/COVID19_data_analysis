# Marketing Plan
  
 
The software name is the Malady Monitor 


# Customers

The original software was a commission marketed towards The NHS analytics, but after an agreement, the software was able to be expanded

The demographic of the Malady Monitor is orientated more towards people who own and manage businesses/corporations. Unlike the ordinary employee/people, a business owner usually observes changes and alterations to society on a global scale. These changes could have an impact heavily on their marketing and profits, thus affecting their livelihood.

# Economics

 We will have 80% of the market due to our history with the Data Analytics Department of the NHS requesting this software as a commission. The 20% has gone to their legal use and allows them to edit the code to their beneficiary needs while we still benefit from the original by bringing it to a larger market.

 In terms of the future market, it will take an estimate of subscribed customers that are loyal for a year to make a profit with a 100% success rate

In a more realistic scenario, let's say a success rate of 80% as the Corona Virus is still relevant today.

50 Customers x 80% = 40 Customers
40 Customers x yearly income £3,120
that is £124,800 at 100% share 
at 80% share that would be £99,840
