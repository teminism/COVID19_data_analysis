4. As an NHS manager, I want to know the amount of predicted COVID infections in the upcoming weeks, so I can rota in enough staff to handle the amount of predicted patients
https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201179-39

Story description: Managers need to have the correct amount of staff on duty so that each patient has all their needed tended too. Without our model, there may be either too many staff members (which is inefficient and wastes time) or not enough (meaning elongated waiting time for patients).

5. As an NHS manager, I want to know how many new COVID infections the UK will get, so I can ensure hospitals have enough PPE for all NHS staff members
https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201179-40

Story description: The NHS provides correct PPE for its staff members in order to keep the hospital clean and to protect staff from contracting COVID. Our model can help the NHS stock up on enough PPE for staff members based on the forecasted amount of COVID deaths and infections. The more infections/deaths, the more staff will be on duty. Therefore, the NHS will have to provide more PPE, our model helps them prepare for this.

# Other modelling techniques
## Case-uses

### Non-Functional requirements:

Use-case title: “Estimate COVID deaths/infections 2,4,6 weeks from now”
Primary actor: Model user (NHS)
(Story): The user should be able to receive the amount of predicted COVID deaths and infections 2,4,6 weeks from the current date. The user can then use this data to help inform them on decisions to make based on whether cases are expected to get better or worse.

Use-Case title: “Estimate data on both deaths AND infections”
Primary actor: Model user (NHS)
(Story): The user should be able to receive data regarding COVID on predicted death and infection rates. This was explained as a requirement, given by the client.

Use-Case title: “Display as a report”
Primary actor: Model user (NHS)
(Story): It is required for the data to be displayed in a report. This makes it easy for the user to interpret the data and to make informed decisions regarding the forecasted data.
 
Use-Case title: “Display visual data”
Primary actor: Model user (NHS)
(Story): The user should be shown visualisations of the COVID data. This was specified by the client. Using visual data in combination with statistical data helps the user make a well-rounded judgement regarding the data. It will also assist them understanding the data, as graphs/visual data can be easily interpreted upon first glance.

### Functional requirements
                                                           
Use-Case title: “The product should be user friendly”
Primary actor: Model user
(Story): The GUI should be easy to navigate and use. This is useful as it allows for a pleasing user experience. The user will not find it useful or pleasant, to use a computer system that is confusing/not user friendly.

Use-Case title: “The product should be useable on mobile and pc”
Primary actor: Model user
(Story): This is useful to the user as it allows accessibility. Maybe the user only has a mobile device and not a PC. Having this feature will allow our computer system to be used by as many users as possible on whatever device they have readily available. 

Use-Case title: “The product should be usable for people who speak other languages”
Primary actor: Model user
(Story): The computer system should come in a few different languages to allow accessibility of the users. We cannot assume that everyone using the model will speak/read English. Therefore, it would be useful to the user if the report could be configured in a few different languages.  



## Risk Log

1. Potential risk: Loosing a section or work by accidently deleting or it becomming corrupted.
There is a medium to low risk of this happening. Sometimes accidental deletion of work happen. 
If this were to happen it would mean that team member would have to re-do all the work the lost. This takes up extra time and will therefore take the team member longer to complete the same amount of work.
To prevent this from happening, we agreed to upload versions of the code as we go along, meaning we always have a recent backup copy available if something were to go wrong.
The story has been assigned to Sezen and has been completed.

2. Potential risk: Poor communication and interaction within team due to team having different schedules. 
There is a very high risk of this happening as we have a fairly large group. This bigger the group the harder it is to efficiently communicate amongst each other and find time we are all available. 
If this were to happen, it would affect the efficiency of our team completing the project.
To prevent this, we have arranged days and times in the week where we are all available. Those specific days and times are reserved for us to all work on the project together. 
The story has been assigned to Sezen and has been completed.

3. Potential risk: Poor team work/efficiently
There is a high risk of this happening, as different people have different ways of learning/doing work. Some may work at a faster pace than others, and some may prefer to hand write rather than type e.c.t. These factors and more, can affect team work. If this were to happen, it would reduce the efficiency of our team completing work.
To prevent this from happening, we have all agreed to frequently communicate with each other and explain the different ways in which we work. This way, we can effectively assign tasks to the person most suited to complete it. We also agreed to communicate if we are unhappy about the task we have been assigned or if we are unhappy about anything regarding the project. This will improve team work as it ensures everyone is happy with what they’re doing. 
The story has been assigned to Sezen and has been completed.

4. Potential risk: Lack of knowledge on how to complete a task
There is a high risk of this happening, as no-one is able to know everything.
If this were to happen, it would reduce work efficiency, as the team member would have to take time away from doing work, to find a solution to the problem.
To prevent this from happening we have agreed to first research online a solution to the problem at hand. Information can be found by watching videos and by reading articles or help forums. If the solution cannot be found online, we will then ask our team mates and try and figure out a solution together. If this fails, then we will resort to emailing the lectures and/or asking for help in the labs.
